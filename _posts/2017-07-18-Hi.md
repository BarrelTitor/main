Hello! My Name is Wych and this is the first post of my blog! I'm not sure what to post here besides??? A quick unordered list of some my favorite stories yes sure.

* Earthbound
* Ryuu no Kawaii Nanatsu no Ko by Ryoko Kui
* Lisa
* Kirby
* Nickelodeon by Douman Seiman
* The Honey Month by Amal El-Mohtar
* Undertale

I have a huge love for the magical realism genre, but all kinds of fantasy are great! I will probably make a post soon enough sharing specific short stories I love. That's it for now, thanks for reading!
